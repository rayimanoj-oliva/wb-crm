### 1. Database Verification

**Status**: âœ… Verified
- Table `zoho_mappings` exists in database
- 40 mappings successfully saved
- Proper table structure with all required fields

**Evidence**:
```
Table: zoho_mappings
Total mappings: 40
Fields: id, treatment_name, zoho_name, zoho_sub_concern, created_at, updated_at
```

### 2. Mapping Examples Saved in Database

| Treatment Name (WhatsApp) | Zoho Name (Saved) | Zoho Sub-Concern |
|---------------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Acne / Acne Scars | **Acne** | Pimple Treatment |
| Pigmentation & Uneven Skin Tone | **Pigmentation** | Pigmentation Treatment |
| Anti-Aging & Skin Rejuvenation | **Skin Concerns** | Anti Aging |

| Hair Transplant | **Hair Transplantation** | DHI / Hair Transplantation / Hair |
| Weight Management | **Weight Loss** | Weight Management |
| Body Contouring | **Inch Loss Treatment** | Fat Loss/Inch Loss |

### 3. How It Works - Step by Step

#### Step 1: User Selects Concern
- User selects "Acne / Acne Scars" from treatment list
- Code stores it in `appointment_state[wa_id]["selected_concern"]`

**Location**: `controllers/web_socket.py:1830-1839`
```python
selected_concern = title or reply_id or ""
if selected_concern:
    appointment_state[wa_id]["selected_concern"] = selected_concern
```

#### Step 2: Lead Creation Retrieves Concern
- When lead is created, system gets the selected concern from state

**Location**: `controllers/components/lead_appointment_flow/zoho_lead_service.py:286-293`
```python
concern_data = appointment_state.get(wa_id, {})
selected_concern = concern_data.get("selected_concern")

# If found, look up Zoho mapping
if selected_concern:
    from services.zoho_mapping_service import get_zoho_name
    zoho_mapped_concern = get_zoho_name(db, selected_concern)
```

#### Step 3: Zoho Name Lookup
- System queries `zoho_mappings` table
- Finds mapping for "Acne / Acne Scars" â†’ "Acne"
- Returns "Acne" as the Zoho name

**Example**:
- Selected: "Acne / Acne Scars"
- Mapped to: **"Acne"**

#### Step 4: Zoho Name Added to Lead Description
- The mapped Zoho name is added to the lead description

**Location**: `controllers/components/lead_appointment_flow/zoho_lead_service.py:329-332`
```python
# Add Zoho mapped concern if available
if zoho_mapped_concern:
    description_parts.append(f"Treatment/Zoho Concern: {zoho_mapped_concern}")
elif selected_concern:
    description_parts.append(f"Treatment: {selected_concern}")
```

#### Step 5: Zoho Name Saved in Lead Details
- Both original and mapped names are saved in appointment_details

**Location**: `controllers/components/lead_appointment_flow/zoho_lead_service.py:370-371`
```python
appointment_details={
    ...
    "selected_concern": selected_concern,
    "zoho_mapped_concern": zoho_mapped_concern
}
```

### 4. What Gets Saved in Zoho CRM Lead

When a lead is created, the description includes:

```
Lead from WhatsApp Lead-to-Appointment Flow | 
City: Hyderabad | 
Clinic: Banjara Hills | 
Preferred Date: 2024-01-15 | 
Preferred Time: Morning (9-11 AM) | 
Treatment/Zoho Concern: Acne | 
Status: PENDING
```

**Key Points**:
- âœ… Original concern: "Acne / Acne Scars" â†’ Stored in `selected_concern`
- âœ… Mapped Zoho name: "Acne" â†’ Stored in `zoho_mapped_concern`
- âœ… Zoho name appears in description as: "Treatment/Zoho Concern: Acne"

### 5. Complete Data Flow
