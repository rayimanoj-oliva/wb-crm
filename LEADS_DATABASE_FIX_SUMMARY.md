# Leads Database Save - Implementation Complete

## Problem
Leads were being created in Zoho CRM but **NOT saved** to the local database.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Leads Table âœ…

**File**: `models/models.py` (lines 612-648)

Added Lead model with the following fields:
```python
class Lead(Base):
    __tablename__ = "leads"
    
    # Zoho connection
    zoho_lead_id = Column(String, unique=True, nullable=False, index=True)
    
    # Lead information
    first_name, last_name, email, phone, mobile
    
    # Lead details
    city, lead_source, lead_status, company, description
    
    # WhatsApp information
    wa_id, customer_id
    
    # Appointment details stored as JSON
    appointment_details = Column(JSONB, nullable=True)
    
    # Treatment/Concern information
    treatment_name, zoho_mapped_concern
    
    # Timestamps
    created_at, updated_at
```

### 2. Created Leads Table in Database âœ…

**File**: `create_leads_table.py`

Script to directly create the leads table:
```bash
python create_leads_table.py
```

**Output**: 
```
âœ… Leads table created successfully!
ðŸ“Š Table has 19 columns
```

### 3. Added Code to Save Leads âœ…

**File**: `controllers/components/lead_appointment_flow/zoho_lead_service.py` (lines 398-438)

After a lead is successfully created in Zoho, it now saves to local database:

```python
if result["success"]:
    # Save lead to local database
    from models.models import Lead
    
    # Check if lead already exists
    existing_lead = db.query(Lead).filter(Lead.zoho_lead_id == result.get('lead_id')).first()
    
    if not existing_lead:
        # Create new lead record
        new_lead = Lead(
            zoho_lead_id=result.get('lead_id'),
            first_name=first_name,
            last_name=last_name,
            email=email,
            phone=phone_number,
            # ... all other fields
        )
        db.add(new_lead)
        db.commit()
        print(f"ðŸ’¾ Lead saved to local database with ID: {new_lead.id}")
```

## What Happens Now

### 1. Lead Created in Zoho âœ…
- Lead is created in Zoho CRM
- Receives Zoho lead ID

### 2. Lead Saved to Local Database âœ…
- Lead data is saved to `leads` table
- Includes all appointment details
- Includes treatment mapping information
- Linked to customer via `customer_id`

### 3. Database Query
You can now query leads in your database:

```sql
SELECT * FROM leads 
WHERE wa_id = '918309866859' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Testing

### Test Lead Creation
1. Create a lead through WhatsApp flow
2. Check logs for: `ðŸ’¾ [LEAD APPOINTMENT FLOW] Lead saved to local database`
3. Query database to verify lead exists

### Verify in Database
```python
from database.db import SessionLocal
from models.models import Lead

db = SessionLocal()
leads = db.query(Lead).all()
for lead in leads:
    print(f"{lead.zoho_lead_id}: {lead.first_name} {lead.last_name} - {lead.wa_id}")
```

## Summary

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Leads table created | âœ… |
| Lead model added | âœ… |
| Database save code | âœ… |
| Treatment mapping | âœ… |
| Appointment details | âœ… |

**Status**: âœ… **COMPLETE**

All leads created in Zoho will now be automatically saved to your local database!
