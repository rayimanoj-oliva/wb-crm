# Complete Payment Verification Guide

This guide shows you exactly how to set up payment verification in your Razorpay integration. You already have the code - you just need to configure the webhook secret.

## üéØ What You Need to Understand

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ Order creation - Working
- ‚úÖ Payment link generation - Working  
- ‚úÖ Razorpay checkout - Working
- ‚ùå **Payment confirmation from Razorpay - Missing Webhook Secret**

### The Problem
When a user completes payment on Razorpay, Razorpay needs to tell your backend "Hey, payment successful!" This happens through webhooks. But your webhook isn't configured yet because you don't have the webhook secret.

## üìã Step-by-Step: Get Your Webhook Secret

### Step 1: Go to Razorpay Dashboard
1. Login to [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.razorpay.com)
2. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Webhooks**
3. Click **"Add New Webhook"**

### Step 2: Configure Your Webhook
Fill in these details:

**Webhook URL:**
```
https://yourdomain.com/payments/webhook
```
> **Important:** Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain where your API is hosted

**For local testing (using ngrok):**
```bash
# First, install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# Then expose your local server
ngrok http 8000

# Use the ngrok URL like:
https://abc123.ngrok.io/payments/webhook
```

**Selected Events:**
Check these boxes:
- ‚úÖ `payment.captured`
- ‚úÖ `payment.failed`
- ‚úÖ `payment.pending`

### Step 3: Copy Your Webhook Secret
After creating the webhook, you'll see:
- **Webhook Secret** - Copy this! (starts with `whsec_`)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configure Your Environment

### For Local Development (.env file):
```bash
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
RAZORPAY_SECRET=your_test_secret
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx  # <-- Add this line
```

### For Production:
```bash
export RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

## üß† How Payment Flow Works (Your Current Setup)

### 1. User Clicks "Pay"
Your code creates a payment link

### 2. User Completes Payment
User completes payment on Razorpay

### 3. Razorpay Sends Webhook
Razorpay automatically calls your webhook endpoint

### 4. Your Webhook Handler
Your code already handles this at `/payments/webhook`

## üì± What Happens When Webhook is Configured

### Without Webhook (Current State):
```
User pays ‚Üí Payment succeeds ‚Üí ‚ùå No confirmation
```

### With Webhook (After Setup):
```
User pays ‚Üí Payment succeeds ‚Üí Webhook fires ‚Üí 
  ‚úÖ Payment status updated
  ‚úÖ Order marked as paid
  ‚úÖ Customer gets WhatsApp confirmation
```

## ‚úÖ Complete Setup Checklist

- [ ] Created Razorpay account
- [ ] Got API Keys (KEY_ID and SECRET)
- [ ] **Got Webhook Secret from Dashboard** ‚Üê You need this!
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Configured webhook URL in Razorpay dashboard
- [ ] Tested webhook with test payment

## üöÄ Quick Start
